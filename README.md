## Methodology

### Project Requirements

- In this JavaScript capstone project we developed a  favorite food app based on an external API.

-We used [Meals DB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) an API that provides data about different types of food.

- We also used  a  Microverse involvement API to post and get likes and comments. [Involvement API](https://us-central1-involvement-api.cloudfunctions.net/capstoneApi/apps/NFxX76uVcS9wzX0LJoyT/)

#### This webapp has 2 user interfaces:

1. A home page showing a list of foods that you can "like."
2. A popup window with more data about an item that we can use to comment on it for a period of time.
